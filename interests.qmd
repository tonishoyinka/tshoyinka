In my spare time, I try to stay as well-rounded as I can.Â I've started reading more lately and I love it, but I fear nothing will ever top "Homegoing" by Yaa Gyasi for me. I'm currently reading "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe and "This Is How You Lose the Time War" by Amal El-Mohtar.

I also love knitting and crocheting. I picked up crocheting at the beginning of this semester and hope to do it more in the coming years.

My favorite hobby of all is definitely baking. During the COVID-19 lockdown, I discovered that I loved making sweet treats almost as much as I liked eating them. I especially love cake decorating and appreciate the magic of a simple chocolate chip cookie. I started a business this semester selling cakes! It's called EPI Cakes! I've just started building my social media, but I've sold quite a few cakes so far and I'm truly excited about this opportunity!
