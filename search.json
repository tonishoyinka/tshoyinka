    "text": "EDUCATION\nCase Western Reserve University - 2026\nBA Epidemiology Candidate\nEXPERIENCE\nAs someone who is interested in public health, there are 2 experiences that have been pivotal in pointing me forward on this path.\nThis past summer, I worked as a Mayoral Fellow at the City of Detroit Health Department within the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases divisions. My project for the Epidemiology division was to conduct informational interviews with the heads of the other divisions within the health department, do thematic analyses of the information gleaned, and develop recommendations on making partnerships with the Epidemiology division more effective. This gave me a stronger understanding of the collaboration necessary to function in public health spaces. With the Communicable Diseases division, I developed a preliminary audit tool for the Michigan Disease Surveillance System which will allow the division to better track how efficiently disease investigations are being handled. This audit tool is now being used to achieve the department’s goal of national accreditation.\nDuring the summer of 2023, I took a study abroad course through CWRU’s Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences in Cape Town, South Africa. Part of this course was to job shadow with community partners. My field placement was with the Department of Social Development in Langa Township. While there, I participated in home visits, intake meetings, and case management discussions. This provided unique insight into the function of social work in post-apartheid South Africa and what it is like working in various cultural infrastructures."

    "text": "Hello, my name is Oluwatoni (Toni) Shoyinka and I’m currently an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University pursuing a Dean’s Approved Major in Epidemiology with a minor in Arabic. My career aspirations are to work in international public health and assist in developing culturally competent health infrastructure that allows developing communities to build upon themselves on their own terms.\nI currently hold positions in many spaces on campus. I work in the Center for Human Genetics at University Hospitals where I conduct insurance prior authorizations to help patients get genetic testing covered and learn about the unique cases dealt with by the Genetic Counselors and physicians in the department. I am the Vice President of Internal Affairs for PERIOD @ CWRU, where I lead campus-wide initiatives to eliminate stigma around menstruation and combat period poverty in Cleveland through Education, Advocacy, and Service. I am also a Tour Guide, Spartan Ambassador, and Orientation Leader, which allows me to connect with prospective and incoming students.\nWhen I’m not pursuing academic endeavors, I enjoy reading, knitting/crocheting, and baking."

    "text": "In my spare time, I try to stay as well-rounded as I can. I’ve started reading more lately and I love it, but I fear nothing will ever top “Homegoing” by Yaa Gyasi for me. I’m currently reading “Things Fall Apart” by Chinua Achebe and “This Is How You Lose the Time War” by Amal El-Mohtar.\nI also love knitting and crocheting. I picked up crocheting at the beginning of this semester and hope to do it more in the coming years.\nMy favorite hobby of all is definitely baking. During the COVID-19 lockdown, I discovered that I loved making sweet treats almost as much as I liked eating them. I especially love cake decorating and appreciate the magic of a simple chocolate chip cookie. I started a business this semester selling cakes! It’s called EPI Cakes! I’ve just started building my social media, but I’ve sold quite a few cakes so far and I’m truly excited about this opportunity!"

    "title": "Career Planning As Discussed in Jeff Leek’s How to Be a Modern Scientist",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I wanted to look into the “How to Be A Modern Scientist” chapter regarding Career Planning. Though that particular chapter is aimed towards graduate and postdoc students, I thought it would be an interesting thing to start looking into. I’m about a year away from finishing my undergrad program, so I’ve started to get a lot of questions about my next steps. This put into context some aspects of entering the workforce that I never considered before.\nLeek mentions the potential detriment of scientific career aspirations driven by altruism: a reduced focus on the career planning and development aspect of entering such a field. At first, I wasn’t sure I agreed. All the students I know who are aspiring to go into science have pretty good ideas of what it is that they want to do. They want to do research, they want to teach, they want to go into industry. However, the more I thought about what Leek was saying, the more I realized that these aspirations were surface-level. When asked about the specifics, students (myself included) begin to flounder and people immediately placate with “it’s okay if you don’t know yet” or “you’ve still got plenty of time”. \nWe’re perfectly content with people saying they’re going into science and having no clue what that’s supposed to look like because it’s been viewed (from the outsider’s perspective) as a protected class of employment in a way. We’ll always need scientists and researchers and professors, so as long as you have the education to become one, you’ll be fine. This does up-and-coming scientific professionals a disservice. Having no career trajectory mapped out, no back-up plan, and no safety net leaves them susceptible to the changing tides of the market. Do you want to work as a tenure track professor at a research institution or at a liberal arts school? Are you more comfortable working a “hard money” job or a “soft money” one? This is especially relevant in a time like this when funding and associated factors are not as secure as they once were. \nEncouraging students, even as early as undergrad, to start asking themselves the questions Leek provides in his Career Planning chapter will make a world of difference in the way the next generation of scientists enter the workforce and learn to advocate for themselves. Knowing what you want and how you want to get it is something that my parents taught me to prioritize early in my life, so seeing it contextualized in this way, in this field that I don’t have as much guidance in, has been incredibly influential. I’m definitely going to fill out the planning worksheet provided and start asking myself questions."
